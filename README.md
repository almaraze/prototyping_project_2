## Introduction

Many game designers want to create games with strong narrative elements – RPG’s, adventure games, cinematic games, etc. – but find that the scope of these projects is overwhelming. Amazing stories can come from simple ideas though, so in this project, you’ll create a story game with quests, non-player characters, and multiple scenes based on a simple premise: going to the store. 

## Project
You will create a game in the GB Studio engine based on the simple idea of going to the store. Designers are challenged to think about different levels of goals (long-term: what are you ultimately buying, vs short-term: what steps must you take first to accomplish the longer goal?), the pacing of puzzles or different challenges, and the layout of their game worlds (is it linear? Do you meander and backtrack? Do you become acquainted with a place via multiple visits?) You should also think about how such a simple errand might play out and build an interesting game story. Does the errand bring up painful memories? Are there rude shoppers? Do you fight someone for the last of an item? Do you get abducted by aliens?! 

### Through this exercise, you will:
    • Explore how interactive narrative can help players craft their own narrative experiences in games
    • Discover the differences between embedded narratives and emergent narratives
    • Express emotions and/or ideas through game mechanics
    • Learn how to build games within strong limitations (screen resolution, colors, animation limits, memory limits, etc.) 
    • Explore how stories are structured in different kinds of game worlds. 

### Game requirements
Each student must create a playable GB Studio adventure game. This consists of:
    • Game should be for 1 player.
    • Base your narrative on the story idea: “Trip to the store to run an errand.”
    • Allow players to take on the role of at least one character in a story
    • Players must be have at least 4 quests to fulfill throughout the game, given to them by NPCs and tracked via the quest system similar to the pre-built one in the engine’s sample project. 
    • Quests should be structured in a hierarchical manner, with short-term quests that build towards the end goal (example: do a quest to get the keys to the car to reach the store)
    • Game world should consist of at least 7 scenes.
